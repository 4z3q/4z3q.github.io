It's one thing to run around in the open -- another mistake is to simply not use or seek cover when fighting. 

Simply having a shoot-out (both players in the open) gives me a low chance of surviving, and if the other player takes 
cover and then re-engages, that gives me even lower chances of surviving. 

Each engagement should be fought in phases or rounds, separated by when the pauses when cover is voluntarily (or 
involuntarily) broken. 

Then, it becomes a game to see who can "break" each other's cover by getting a better angle on your opponent. 

Lastly, the maps in PUBG are made for this situation: there is very rarely a lone house on flat plain. In fact, 
there's very rarely even a flat plain -- even in the wheat fields, there are haystacks.

Yup, instead of shooting from cover and resetting the engagement (in and out of cover), I shoot from the open.

    </td><td valign="top">
This was early on when I started playing and I completely missed the player lying next to the recall point as I ran by. 
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I'm shooting from out in the open, without any cover.

Ironically, this player shoots maybe half of his bullets into the railing or the wall, but he still manages to kill me. 
<br/><br/>
The obvious lesson is using cover efficiently matters more than how well you aim.

Here, you're seeing the tail end of the engagement: I had shot at them from the village and they stopped to engage. 
<br/>
<br/>
And there I am shooting at them in the open while they have cover behind a house.

When you're pushing a static player in cover, then it's doubly dangerous. 
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, he pushes outside as well, which I'm not sure was the best move.

    </td><td valign="top">
First off, notice how the other player is moving from cover to cover as he goes up the hill. This is how it should 
be done. 
<br/><br/>
What you do not see, is that I run almost blindly out of Science Center, without any regard for cover.

Another player who runs out into the open, without cover to engage. 
<br/><br/>
However, if you look closely, you'll notice his teammate waiting behind the shack on the right. Even if I had taken 
them out, their teammate would have eliminated me.

So, this was a situation where I <i>could</i> have used cover to reset engagement and also to isolate the duo from 
eachother. 
<br/>
<br/>
But I didn't.

I was doing really well, given that I surprised him from the corner and also kind of initially used cover. 
<br/><br/>
But then I ran out into the room, and stood there shooting him.

This engagement also started fairly well, but ended badly when I gave him the advantage of <i>having cover</i>
inside 
the room, while I stood out on the roof <i>without cover</i>.

    </td><td valign="top">
I had all of the advantages here, but then I basically just walked into their sights. 
<br/><br/>
If I had simply applied pressure with a grenade and then mowed them down as they ran out, I might have won the 
engagement.

  </td><td valign="top">
This was basically a 2 vs 3, but I destroyed any chances we had by positioning myself in the middle and in the open. 
<br/><br/>
I should have retreated to one of the houses and defended or attacked from there. I should have figured out which 
angles I could take.
