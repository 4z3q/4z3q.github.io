In general, unless no one can see you, you should not be standing still. It just makes it easier for anyone who happens to see you to hit you. 

<table style="width: 100%; border: none;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">

I had no clue that the shooter was there. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was just looking around, outside on the balcony, and got headshot.  
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion: when looking around, use 3rd person views while shielding/hiding your body or take quick peaks.

This is again very obvious: I also did not know he was lying ("snaking") in the grass. 
<br/>
<br/>
In this case, I'm in the house, but in the 1-2 seconds I stand still, he knocks and kills me.
