Leaning out to take a shot or peak can easily display my whole profile. 

To start with, I need to be careful about only showing my head, but more importantly, it should be a quick peak. 

Hard peaking, or looking for several seconds while displaying my profile, raises the chances of me dying, even if 
it's a good lean.

Notice how they are dynamic and constantly changing position, instead of statically firing from the top of the rock. 
<br/><br/>
Of course, he already had a very good position with regards to us, but that's a different lesson.

Perhaps the best example of a bad lean. 
<br/><br/>
Note his patience and the 2-3 seconds that he takes between peeking out. In those 2-3 seconds, he can just barely see the crate.

Another bad lean -- and hard peak -- that I literally hold for roughly 8 seconds, including the 4-5 when they're 
healing.

    </td><td valign="top">
Again, a lean in which I expose my whole body. 
<br/><br/>
Notice how he resets the engagement between players by retreating to cover.

I was spotted here only by accident because of my bad lean -- and hard peak. 
<br/><br/>
In my defense, I was trying to throw a grenade. But again, there's no reason to lean while waiting.

I could have used my third-person perspective (TPP) to see him coming and then take him out, given he was in the open. 
<br/><br/>
But it was a bad lean.

    </td><td valign="top">
Here, I should have known better than to even take a peak. 
<br/><br/>
One or two smokes would have done wonders.
