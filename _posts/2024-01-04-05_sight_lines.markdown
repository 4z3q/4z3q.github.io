In some sense, PUBG (Mobile) is a game of "who sees who first".

And preventing someone from seeing you is the same as being aware of the "sightlines" -- how people can see you.

If I had stayed next to the building (instead of walking out into the open), I would not have been visible to them.

Before this happened, I had not thought about how this low balcony did not give any real cover. 
<br/><br/>
Now, I think more and more about the angles that each building or landscape feature actually provide cover for.

The piers on both Livik and Erangel are incredibly dangerous because of how visible I am on them.

I had not thought about how the large open doorways expose me to a number of sightlines. 
<br/><br/>
I also now know that the waffle is an infamous camping spot, so that also helps.

A very good example of a third-party kill.

Also a good example of sightlines for buildings on a cliff.
