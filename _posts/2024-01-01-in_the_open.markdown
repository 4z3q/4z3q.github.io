In short, if I run through an open field, there's a good chance someone will see me, shoot me and that I'll die. 

Even worse, if I shoot at someone from an open field, it's almost certain that I'll die.

This remains the most obvious example for me of why running (or walking) through an open field is folly.

With a little bit of luck, they could have just run me over. Besides that, I was just an easy target. 
<br/><br/>
Notice how they turn to the <i>right</i> with their car, so that when they jump out, they immediately have cover. 
They then basically take their time to eliminate me. Well played!

In short, I ran out of the Science Center without really looking around. And I ran into a team coming up the hill. 
<br/><br/>
Notice how as they run up the hill, their constantly seeking cover. That's the subjecet of the next lesson, "No Cover".

I'm pretty sure I had been shooting at them, but not sure if I took that first guy out. 
<br/><br/>
In any case, it's one thing to be running around in the open -- attracting attention while doing it will get you 
killed even faster!

During an engagement, running out into the open will just get you killed.

This is pretty soon after the drop, and here I am running around in the open. 
<br/><br/>
Even with a holo sight and a mini, it's easy enough to take me out.

I think I even knew when I was shoting at them that it was a really bad idea. 
<br/><br/>
Notice how they immediately jump to try to avoid fire (not a good idea). Instead of immediately taking cover, 
he turns around, which is risky. And, then they also walk out into the open while firing.

He can barely see me with his red dot, but they has the m14, which is a spray machine, so they don't really need to 
see me. 
<br/><br/>
I can barely see him, so the odds are overwhelmingly in his favor.

So, this might seem to be a little different than the rest of these deaths, because I'm in or near a house during 
the encounter.
<br/><br/>
But when I ran out to pursue their buddy, I'm basically running out into the open. 
<br/><br/>
Sightlines from almost every direction, also an opportunity for anyone who wanted to third-party me.

This might also seem to be different, seeing as I'm <i>near</i> a rock. But I'm still basically lying out there in 
the open. 
<br/><br/>
It's easy enough for them to get an angle. 
<br/><br/>
Note that there's lots of open space on Livik, and one of the main challenges is crossing it safely.
